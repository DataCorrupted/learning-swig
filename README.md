# learning-swig

This repo is created to learn swig. It has code I write to play with swig to create python-c++ interface.

It all started when I have a O(n^2m^2) problem where n=32, m=30000+. The front end was written in python and I didn't bother to change it. So I used C++ to do the heavy lifting. :)

You can check swig [here](http://www.swig.org/), it is really handy.
